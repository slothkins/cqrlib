    Parallelize jobs, return a dataframe or series.
    Example: df1=mp_pandas_obj(func,('molecule',df0.index),24,**kwds)
    First, atoms are grouped into molecules, using linParts (equal number of atoms per molecule)
    or nestedParts (atoms distributed in a lower-triangular structure). When mpBatches is greater
    than 1, there will be more molecules than cores. Suppose that we divide a task into 10 molecules,
    where molecule 1 takes twice as long as the rest. If we run this process in 10 cores, 9 of the
    cores will be idle half of the runtime, waiting for the first core to process molecule 1.
    Alternatively, we could set mpBatches=10 so as to divide that task in 100 molecules. In doing so,
    every core will receive equal workload, even though the first 10 molecules take as much time as the
    next 20 molecules. In this example, the run with mpBatches=10 will take half of the time consumed by
    mpBatches=1.
    Second, we form a list of jobs. A job is a dictionary containing all the information needed to process
    a molecule, that is, the callback function, its keyword arguments, and the subset of atoms that form
    the molecule.
    Third, we will process the jobs sequentially if numThreads==1 (see Snippet 20.8), and in parallel
    otherwise (see Section 20.5.2). The reason that we want the option to run jobs sequentially is for
    debugging purposes. It is not easy to catch a bug when programs are run in multiple processors.
    Once the code is debugged, we will want to use numThreads>1.
    Fourth, we stitch together the output from every molecule into a single list, series, or dataframe.
    :param func: (function) A callback function, which will be executed in parallel
    :param pd_obj: (tuple) Element 0: The name of the argument used to pass molecules to the callback function
